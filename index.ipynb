In other cases, e.g. you want to store data in an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-overview.html), you might want to allow anyone to download the data, but only allow yourself to upload.\n", "\n", "In our curriculum examples we'll advise on IAM settings, but you'll likely need to do your own research as you explore beyond these for your own projects.
